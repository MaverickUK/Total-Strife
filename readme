Codename: “Total Strife”
Here’s a sneak peek of my Christmas 2011 project, it’s a 2D sprite engine built in JavaScript using all the HTML5 goodness I can pack in.
It all started when I saw NetKeen in action and first thought the developer had created it from scratch. Looking deeper I found that it was actually a reverse enginnering job - which explained why the gameplay seemed so faithful to the original.

I also found out that setting up NetKeen sounded like a bit of a pain, involving DosBox and hoop jumping needed to get the network support to play ball. Also it’s hampered by memory restrictions, resulting in small levels.
So I figured, why don’t I create a NetKeen style engine using JavaScript. With the canvas tag to output video, sound support and even networking socket support it should be possible!?
After an evenings work this video shows my I’ve managed to put together so far, not bad! Although I must heavily credit John Graham who created the basic canvas drawing and sprite animation code.
What I’ve added so far is:
jQuery keyboard bindings to move your sprite
Changable spritesheets (Which is way there’s Keen and Guybrush)
Music and sound effects (Really just using Buzz.js)
Basic physics (Gravity, drag etc…)
